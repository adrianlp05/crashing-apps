An infinite loop is not a DoS attack. What is inside that loop makes it interesting: it triggers a DoS attack by is flooding the History API with back and forward calls. Because of that, it triggers synchronous IPC and cause the main process to hang up to the freeze of the OS as the memory gets consumed.

But I don't even know why we're talking about this here. You are on a completely different bug, the one you mentioned is the Chrome one (even though it somewhat works in Firefox on Linux).
